### What it does
VReact is a project that addresses the need for more hands-on approaches to learning intangible topics, particularly learning about molecules and chemical reactions that are often taught in chemistry. Currently, the user is able to interact with a library of molecules by selecting the molecule and having a list of information about the molecule appear. An example reaction is given and the user is able to see the reaction's products. We hope to improve this project so that users can have more control over the manipulation of molecules in reactions, and they can have more control over their learning.

### What you need to see how it works
It is still not a full application, but you can download [Unity](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) and import the VReact.unitypackage into Unity. 
With [Oculus Rift](https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/setup/) connected to your computer, you can view it and use space bar to click on molecules and buttons.
